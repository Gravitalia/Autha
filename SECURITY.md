## Reporting a Vulnerability
> Critical vulnerability

As soon as the vulnerability is critical, it is urgent to warn, not on GitHub (you can still do it in the `GitHub Security Advisories`) but on an official network, a developer or administrator.<br />
You can join the **Discord** server available in the `readme` of the code.

> Minor or medium vulnerability

If you think the vulnerability is minimal, you can report it in the `GitHub PR`, on the `GitHub Security Advisories` or on the **Discord** server (available in the `readme`).
